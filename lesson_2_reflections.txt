1.What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans.Initializing a repository means creating a new Git repository. It is used to create an empty repository or convert a directory
with files to a Git repository in order to track files in the directory.

2.How is the staging area different from working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans.Staging area is the intermediate area between working directory and the repository where files can be added before assigning
to a commit. This allows files to be grouped so that they represent a logical change.
